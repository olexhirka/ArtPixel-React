### Did you know that you can draw and animate pixel art using CSS?

**pixel-art-react** is a handy and intuitive tool, that can help you to design your awesome drawings and animations!

Try to draw some pixels on the screen, **pixel-art-react** will generate the CSS code using **box-shadow** property.

Create as much drawings as you want in your project adding new frames and then check them in motion! it will use CSS **keyframes** to get the animation done and the CSS code will be ready to use in your HTML blocks.

Please check the following example:

The app layout is responsive and adjust itself to the screen width. You can see different layout examples (desktop and mobile) in the screenshot.

The project is built with **React**, **Redux** and **ImmutableJS**. Trying to avoid side-effects in a functional way of programming.

You will be able to **load**, **save**, **import**, **export** projects, **undo** **redo** your actions, change grid properties, **share** your drawings/animations and **download** them, everything in a very easy and fast way.

Check the results of this simple project:
